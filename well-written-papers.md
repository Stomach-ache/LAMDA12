### Several criteria to distinguish high-quality papers
1. Self-contained: do not leave important concepts unexplained to readers.
2. Crystal clear
3. Does this paper provide **New findings/insights** in the forcused research field?
4. Does the rationale begind new observations or conclusions well explained? (why the proposed method is superior?)
5. Is the problem setting resonable or practical? (Is the studied problem significant?)
